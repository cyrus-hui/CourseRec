Humans alter plants using breeding and biotechnology, and use them to enhance their environments and their cultural activities. Using introductory concepts from the life sciences, this course explores these vital relationships between humans and plants.',\n",

Students will study the form and format of half-hour and one hour episodic comedies and dramas intended to be encompassed as part of a television series. They will also undertake the pitching, outlining and drafting of a single episode; the creation and development of a series proposal; the make up and function of a story department; plus an overview of the industry as a whole. Long form drama including television movies and mini-series will also be examined.',\n",
